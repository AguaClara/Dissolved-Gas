### Current Manual (in progress)

The purpose of this document is to keep up-to-date all aspects of the current prototype's fabrication process. Each iteration is documented in its respective Report.

The Methods section of each successive report must be updated to agree with the current Manual.

## Manual

This manual lays out the details of the materials and methods used for the aforementioned experiments and fabrication.

### Experimental Methods

#### Determining the Porosity of Silica Sand [Complete, no edit necessary]

The porosity of silica sand was needed to calculate the sand bed's fluidization velocity ([Equation 1](#Equation-1)). The following procedure was used to determine the porosity of the silica sand used in the reactor, based on the procedure outlined by [Worth, 2018](https://socratic.org/questions/how-do-scientists-measure-the-porosity-of-soil). The equation for determining porosity may be verified by dimensional analysis in comparison with the equation found in the source: [Department of Chemical Engineering, 2017](http://ww2.che.ufl.edu/unit-ops-lab/experiments/FB/FB-manual.pdf).

**Set-Up**
1. Acquire silica sand, water, and two graduated cylinders.
2. Transfer a portion of the sand to a graduated cylinder and record the sand bed’s volume. This is the “sample volume”, $V_{sample}$.
3. Pour an excess volume of water into a second graduated cylinder. Record this volume.

**Experiment**
1. Pour water from its graduated cylinder into the graduated cylinder containing sand until the meniscus’ peak is level with that of the sand bed. This equates to saturating the sand with water.
2. Record the volume of water remaining in its respective graduated cylinder. Subtract this volume from the initial volume of water present in the graduated cylinder; the difference is the volume of water used to saturate the sand. This quantity is the "pore volume", $V_{pore}$.
3. Repeat the Set-Up and Experimental Steps 1-2  until three trials’ worth of data has been recorded.
4. Use [Equation 8](#Equation-8) to calculate the sand’s average porosity ($\phi$).

$$\phi = \frac{V_{pore}}{V_{sample}}$$


#### Determining the Average Diameter of Silica Sand Grains [Complete, no edit necessary]

The average diameter of the silica sand grains was needed to calculate the sand bed’s fluidization velocity ([Equation 1](#Equation-1)). The subteam used the following procedure to approximate the average diameter of the sand grains.

1. Acquire a sample of silica sand and a digital caliper.
2. Randomly select a number of sand grains, preferably greater than or equal to ten, from the sample.
3. Using the caliper, measure each sand grain’s diameter three times to account for the grains’ asymmetrical natures. Record these measurements.
4. Compute the average diameter for all sand grains in the sample.

#### Measuring Pipe Dimensions [Complete, no edit necessary]

The prototype fluidized bed reactor was comprised of a transparent PVC pipe containing a silica sand bed, modified with components specified in the Fabrication Manual.

**Set-Up**
The subteam cut the pipe to be a particular length prior to taking measurements.
1. Acquire a transparent PVC pipe of approximately 1” diameter, a Sawzall reciprocating saw, colored tape in two shades, permanent markers, measuring tape, and a caliper.
2. Use a measuring tape and marker to indicate a length of 0.5 m on the PVC pipe. Cut the PVC pipe using the Sawzall such that it matches this length.
3. Wrap tape of opposing colors on opposing ends of the pipe, but *leave several inches between the edge of the pipe and the tape itself*. The tape should be several inches from the edge of the pipe. Use this tape to maintain awareness of the pipe's orientation.

**Measurement**
1. Use a caliper to take the following measurements on both opposite ends of the pipe:
- Measure the thickness of the pipe’s wall in three locations. Compute the average thickness of the pipe’s wall.
- Measure the diameter of the pipe (including the wall) in three locations. These measurements are of the pipe’s “outer diameter”. Compute the average outer diameter of the pipe.
- Subtract twice the wall’s thickness from the outer diameter; the difference is the “inner diameter”. Use this quantity to calculate the cross-sectional area of the pipe.
2. Compute the average cross-sectional area of the pipe, using the measurements taken at both ends.

Recall **Figure 7** from the Methods section. The above flow connector enables the reactor (pipe) to be connected to clear flex tubing.

13. 200 kPa pressure sensor
14. ProCoDA Box
15. **_____ hard tubing (for the pressure sensor)**
16. Teflon tape
17. 1/4 " Threaded push-to-connect component
18. 1/4 " 18NPT Pipe Tap
18. Medium clear PVC cement

**Fabrication**
1. **Edit** To install the pressure sensor, use a 1/4" 18NPT Pipe Tap to tap the pipe 70 cm from its bottom (influent) end. Tap the aperture. Thread a push-to-connect component into the tapped aperture, with the connection made watertight with Teflon tape.
2. **Edit** Insert **_____** hard tubing into the connector. Insert the negative end of the pressure sensor into the exposed tubing, sealing with medium clear PVC cement.
3. Cut the wire mesh to obtain a circular mesh whose radius is approximately that of the pipe.
4. Place the mesh at the bottom of the pipe reactor, at the side designated for influent to enter the pipe. Place this mesh into the flow component that from (12.).
5. Pour the 70 mL of sand into the pipe, such that it settles on the mesh.
6. Fasten the second copy of the flow component from (12.) to the effluent (top) end of the reactor.

11. Cut approximately 2.7 m of 3/16-inch diameter clear flex tubing. Connect this to the effluent (upper) end of the reactor, and lead it down into the bucket.
12. Connect the 200 kPa pressure sensor to the ProCoDA box.
