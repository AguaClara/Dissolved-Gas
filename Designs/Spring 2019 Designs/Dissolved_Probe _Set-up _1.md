# Installing a Nalgene Container to test Dissolved Oxygen
This will be added to the Manual for the third report draft.

A Nalgene container was placed between a large accumulator and the effluent water from the fluidized bed reactor. The purpose of the container is in order to measure the Dissolved Oxygen of only the recent processed water that has gone through the fluidized bed reactor. This is done in order to not measure data of a large volume of water that has accumulated over time.

**Materials used:**
- 5/16" drill bit
- Clear flex tubing
   - 0.312" outer diameter
   - 0.200" inner diameter
- 500 mL Nalgene Bottle

**Instructions:**

1. Using the 5/16" drill bit a hole on the lower end of the Nalgene container
2. Cut clear flex tubing and inserted on the hole
3. Insert the effluent tubing of the fluidized bed reactor into the Nalgene bottle
4. Insert the effluent tubing of the Nalgene bottle into a bigger accumulator of water

**Note:** this is a temporary set-up. Further actions under consideration are securing the tube with PVC cement and using a push-to-connect
