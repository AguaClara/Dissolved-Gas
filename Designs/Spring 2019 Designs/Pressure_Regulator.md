#Pressure Regulator

A pressure regulator, also known as a reducing valve, was installed between the sink and the influent end of the tubing. This was done to maintain consistent water flow into the peristaltic pump.

A piece 26" 3/8 diameter hard plastic tubing was attached between the sink and the reducing valve. The other side of the reducing valve was connected directly to the influent tubing.
