#Pressure Regulator

A pressure regulator was installed between the sink and the influent end of the tubing. This was done to maintain consistent water flow into the peristaltic pump.

A piece 26" 3/8 diameter hard plastic tubing was used to connect the reducing valve to the sink. The other side of the reducing valve was connected directly to the influent tubing.
