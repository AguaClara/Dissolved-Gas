# Installing a Valve on Flow Accumulator

A valve was installed between the T push-to-connect and the flow accumulator to have better control over the water flow

1. Locate the clear flex tubing between the T push-to-connect and the flow accumulator
2. Cut the clear flex tubing approximately 1 inch from the T push to connect.
3. Cut the clear flex tubing again, 2 inches to the right of the original cut
4. Discard the loose piece of clear flex tubing
5. Install the valve between the ends of the clear flex tubing **find better wording**

**2 pictures of the valve can be found in the images folder**
