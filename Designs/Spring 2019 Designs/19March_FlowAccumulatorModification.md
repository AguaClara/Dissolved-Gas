# 19 March: Addition to the Flow Accumulator
This will be added to the Manual for the third report draft.

Materials used:
- 1/2" drill bit
- Clear flex tubing
   - 0.932" outer diameter
   - 0.62" inner diameter
- Large bucket

Instructions:
- Drill a 1/2" hole on the side of the flow accumulator, on the opposite side of the influent push-to-connect, about half-way up the bottle
- Insert the clear flex tubing into the hole
- Place the large bucket on the floor underneath the flow accumulator
- Place the other end of the clear flex tubing into the bucket

**Note:** this is a temporary set-up. Further actions under consideration are securing the tube with PVC cement and using a push-to-connect
