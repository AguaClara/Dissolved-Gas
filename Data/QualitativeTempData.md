# Amount of Bubble Formation vs Temperature

### Experimental Design
- Take video recordings or bubble formation using hot (supersaturated) water and cold (unsaturated) water
- 'Hot' will be defined by the warmest temperature the local faucet can produce. A hot plate can be used if this baseline temperature does not produce a large enough temperature difference
- 'Cold' will be defined by the coldest temperature that the faucet will produce
- Temperatures
