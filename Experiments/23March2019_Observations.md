### Observations and issues
#### 23 March

The subteam observed bubbles entering the system when running hot water. The bubbles entered the system in the entrance of the forked tubing system. Bubbles were also observed to form in the tubing leading from the sink to the forked tubing system.

This behavior was not observed while the subteam introduced cold water into the system.

The subteam believed that this difference occurred because of the temperature dependency of the solubility of gases in a liquid. This was not a desirable feature of the experiments, as the subteam was qualitatively testing the behavior of bubble formation in the fluidized bed reactor.

The subteam began to consider solutions to this issue.
