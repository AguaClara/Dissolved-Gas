The ProCoda system only allows for 4 probes to be connected simultaneously. The subteam's experimental set-up involves 2 temperature probes, 2 dissolved oxygen probes, and a pressure sensor. Therefore, one of these probes must be disconnected at all times for any future experiments.

The immediate goal of the subteam was to determine quantitatively if the fluidized bed successfully removes dissolved oxygen from the influent water. The subteam hypothesized that when the peristaltic pump is run at a consistent rpm, the pressure inside of the reactor would be the same on average. If this is true, then future experiments could be run using both temperature probes and both dissolved oxygen probes, assuming an environment of constant pressure. This setup would allow the subteam to directly compare the dissolved oxygen concentrations of the water before and after it flowed through the reactor, and conclude whether or not the current fluidized bed system is a feasible design.

The subteam ran an experiment to test if the pressure inside of the reactor was the same on average for hot and cold water respectively. The rpm of the peristaltic pump was held constant at 70.0 rpm. Pressure sensor data was recorded as water was pumped from the reactor for approximately 5 minutes. Two trials were conducted for both hot water and cold water. The data was averaged and ...

The subteam concluded that the pressure sensor could be temporarily excluded from data collection.
