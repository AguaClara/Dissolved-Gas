The subteam began experiments to quantitatively determine if the fluidized bed removes dissolved oxygen from the influent flow. The peristaltic pump was run at 70.0 rpm. Temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements were taken in both the influent and effluent flow accumulators.

DO Probe 1: Influent
DO Probe 2: Effluent

## Notes:
Trial 1: hot water
- The effluent DO is higher than the influent DO
Trial 2: Cold water
- The effluent DO is higher than the influent DO, similarly to trial 1

 The subteam decided that the first component of any subsequent DO experiment would be to test that the pressure sensor is behaving the same on average to previous days.
