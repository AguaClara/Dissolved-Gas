# Temperature Range of Sink

Goal: To determine the maximum and minimum temperatures that the laboratory sink can produce

1. Do not turn on the peristaltic pump, to prevent water from flowing to the reactor, as it is not a part of this experiment
2. Set up ProCoDa to record temperature data, ensure that temperature probe is inside the flow accumulator
3. Start temperature data collection
4. Turn on the cold side of the faucet, and indicate the start of the test using a ProCoDa comment
5. Stop taking measurements when the bucket fills to the orange line
6. Turn off the faucet
7. repeat steps 4-6 with hot water
8. Repeat the entire experiment (ie. steps 1-7) 3 times

**March 19 2019**
3 experimental trials conducted (ie. 3 hot water and 3 cold water)

**March 21 2019**
The effluent bucket of the flow accumulator was switched for one of similar size. A hole was drilled in the top, and the effluent tube of the flow accumulator was inserted into the hole.

Procedure was the same as the previous trials, except that each trial was stopped when the water level in the effluent bucket of the flow accumulator reached the top of the red tape.

4 cold water trials were conducted (2 of which were 'duds')
1 hot water test was conducted according to the steps above
