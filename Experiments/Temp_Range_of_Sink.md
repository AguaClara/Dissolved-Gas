# Temperature Range of Sink

Goal: To determine the maximum and minimum temperatures that the laboratory sink can produce

1.  Do not turn on the peristaltic pump, to prevent water from flowing to the reactor, as it is not a part of this experiment
2.  Set up ProCoDa to record temperature data, ensure that temperature probe is inside the flow accumulator
3. Start temperature data collection
4. Turn on the cold side of the faucet, and indicate the start of the test using a ProCoDa comment
5. Stop taking measurements when the bucket fills to the orange line
6. Turn off the faucet
7. repeat steps 4-6 with hot water
8. Repeat the entire experiment 3 times
