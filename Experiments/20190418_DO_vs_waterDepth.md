From experiments in Quantitative_DO_Test.md, the subteam observed that the dissolved oxygen content in the effluent water was higher than the dissolved oxygen content of the influent water.

The subteam hypothesized that one of the DO probes was calibrated incorrectly. The subteam submerged both probes simultaneously in bucket of water and recorded the DO readings over several minutes and graphed the results. The subteam observed that the difference in temperature probe readings was small compared to the difference in readings that were seen between the influent and effluent buckets in the experiments on 12 April 2019. The subteam concluded that the DO probes were in fact calibrated correctly and that another factor caused the DO concentration in the effluent to be greater than the influent concentration.

The subteam hypothesized that the depth of the water in the flow accumulator affects the dissolved oxygen concentration measured there. The subteam filled the effluent flow accumulator to the top using tap water, and recorded the dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature while the water level drained. DO Probe 1 (effluent) and the effluent temperature probe were used in this experiment. The subteam conducted 4 trials.

For the first 4 trials, the subteam graphed DO concentration vs time. In the first trial, the DO concentration generally decreased over time and in trials 2-4 the concentration first increased and then decreased. **add specifics about data** The subteam concluded that the depth of the water in the flow accumulator does in fact influence the reading of the dissolved oxygen concentration. The reason for this correlation was unclear. In the current flow accumulator set-up, the water depth of the influent flow accumulator was higher than that of the effluent. Allowing the water depths to be different was an experimental oversight, and the subteam decided to make adjustments to the effluent flow accumulator so that the water depth was the same for influent and the effluent.

The depth of water at equilibrium in the influent flow accumulator was approximately 15.75 cm, measured from the bottom of the 500 mL nalgene bottle to the top of the water when the pump is running. The subteam acquired a new 500 mL nalgene for the effluent flow accumulator and drilled a hole with a 5/16" drill bit 15.75 cm from the bottom of the nalgene. (15.75 cm measured from the bottom of the nalegene to the top of the hole)
